# File-Name-Reader

To run,

Make sure print-all-file-name.py and ur input directory are in the same directory.

Open cmd in the same directory as the files here, and type the below and press Enter:


      python print-all-file-name.py testcase2



Note that instead of **testcase2**, it should be your **input directory name**.



The sample files should produce the output below, as copy and pasted from cmd:

            C:\Users\User\Downloads\Test\New folder>python print-all-file-name.py testcase1
            food

            C:\Users\User\Downloads\Test\New folder>python print-all-file-name.py testcase2
            dancer
